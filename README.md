# hpbooks

hpbooks[H-P-books] is a web application in which people who wish to read a book but do not have enough money can be given the book by people who wish to help them.

## Goals

I have a dream in which

- **Every human knows the joy and pleasure of intelectual activity.**
- **People who knows about the joy are encouraged to do intelectual activity.**

I want to take a step to these two goals by building hpbooks.
